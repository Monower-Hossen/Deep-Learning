    "# Deep Learning 02: Core Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to my Deep Learning documentation!  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we continue focusing on important training concepts in neural networks:  \n",

    "- Vanishing Gradient Problem  \n",
    "- Chain Rule in Backpropagation  \n",
    "- Dropout Neurons  \n",

    "#  Vanishing Gradient Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks often face the **Vanishing Gradient Problem** during training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is it?  \n",
    "- In deep networks, gradients become **very small** as they propagate backward.  \n",
    "- This makes weight updates negligible in early layers → **network stops learning**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why does it happen?  \n",
    "- Sigmoid and Tanh activations squash values into a small range.  \n",
    "- Their derivatives are small:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x)) \\quad \\in (0, 0.25)\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tanh'(x) = 1 - \\tanh^2(x) \\quad \\in (0, 1)\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiplying many small derivatives → gradient approaches 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Symptoms  \n",
    "- Accuracy stops improving after a few epochs.  \n",
    "- Model seems \"stuck\" at some accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions  \n",
    "1. Use **ReLU / Leaky ReLU** instead of Sigmoid/Tanh.  \n",
    "2. Apply **Batch Normalization** → keeps activations stable.  \n",
    "3. Use better **optimizers** (Adam, RMSProp).  \n",
    "4. **Dropout Neurons** → improves generalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#  Chain Rule in Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is based on the **Chain Rule of Calculus**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Formula  \n",
    "If:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = f(g(x))\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then derivative:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "## In Neural Networks  \n",
    "- Error flows backward from **Output → Hidden → Input**.  \n",
    "- Each layer’s gradient is computed as a product of partial derivatives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example (simple 2-layer NN):  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L = f(z), \\quad z = g(h), \\quad h = w \\cdot x\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dL}{dw} = \\frac{dL}{dz} \\cdot \\frac{dz}{dh} \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dw}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This shows how gradients are **chained** across layers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Dropout Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is a **regularization technique** used to prevent overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Dropout?  \n",
    "- During training, **random neurons are dropped** (set to 0).  \n",
    "- This forces the network to not depend on specific neurons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example  \n",
    "- Suppose a layer has 100 neurons.  \n",
    "- If dropout = 0.5 → only ~50 neurons are active at each step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## At Inference (Testing)  \n",
    "- No dropout is applied.  \n",
    "- Weights are **scaled** to match training conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    " Dropout improves generalization and reduces overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Optimization in Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizers control **how weights are updated** during training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##  Types of Gradient Descent  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)  \n",
    "- Updates weights after **each sample**.  \n",
    "- Faster but noisy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)  \n",
    "- Uses the **entire dataset** for each update.  \n",
    "- Very accurate but slow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Mini-Batch Gradient Descent  \n",
    "- Uses small batches of data.  \n",
    "- Default choice in practice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Advanced Optimizers  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)  \n",
    "- Combines **momentum + adaptive learning rate**.  \n",
    "- Very popular for deep learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adamax  \n",
    "- Variant of Adam.  \n",
    "- Works better with **sparse gradients**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adadelta  \n",
    "- Dynamically adjusts learning rate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### RMSProp  \n",
    "- Keeps moving average of squared gradients.  \n",
    "- Prevents exploding/vanishing updates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy  \n",
    "- Similar to categorical cross-entropy, but labels are **integers** instead of one-hot.  \n",

    "#  Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backpropagation = **Forward Propagation + Chain Rule + Weight Updates**.  \n",
