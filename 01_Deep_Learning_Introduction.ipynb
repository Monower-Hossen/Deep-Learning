    "# Deep Learning 01: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my Deep Learning documentation!  \n",
    "These notes are based on my classroom learning, with additional explanations, examples, and illustrations to make concepts clearer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal is to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Deep Learning.  \n",
    "- Document each concept in a structured way for future reference.  \n",
    "- Share knowledge with peers and the community.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the basics of neural networks, forward & backward propagation, epochs, and activation functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming days, I’ll keep adding **ANN, CNN, RNN**, and other deep learning concepts with examples.\n",

    "## What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of **Machine Learning (ML)** where we use **neural network architectures** with multiple layers to automatically learn features from data.\n",
    "- ML algorithms require feature engineering (manually extracting features).\n",
    "- DL algorithms learn these features automatically from raw data (numbers, images, audio, text).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles **complex data** like images, videos, speech, and text.\n",
    "- Learns hierarchical features:\n",
    "    - Example: In image recognition, first layers detect edges, next detect shapes, final layers detect objects.\n",
    "- Powers modern applications like **speech recognition, translation, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Works well with **large datasets.**\n",
    "- Reduces the need for **manual feature engineering.**\n",
    "- Excellent at handling **unstructured data** (image, video, audio, text).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires **a lot of data.**\n",
    "- Needs **high computational power (GPUs/TPUs).**\n",
    "- Difficult to **interpret (black box models).**\n",
    "- Training can take a **long time.**\n",

    "# Types of Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    " Deep learning is built on neural networks. Depending on data type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** → For structured numerical data.\n",
    "- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** → For images and videos.\n",
    "- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)** → For sequential data like text or time series.\n",
    "\n",
    " All three are **Neural Network Architectures (NNA).**\n",

    "##  Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "- The basic unit of a neural network.  \n",
    "- Receives inputs, applies **weights**, passes through an **activation function**, and gives an output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical representation:**\n",

    "## Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One neuron connected to another neuron** forms a **Neural Network**.  \n",
    "- The strength of the connection is represented by **weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "- The simplest form of a neuron.  \n",
    "- Makes decisions by combining inputs with weights.  \n",
    "- The **signal passing between neurons is called a synapse**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layers\n",
    "1. **Input Layer (IP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Takes the raw features.  \n",
    "   - Example: `play (x1), study (x2), sleep (x3)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Processes inputs with weights and activation functions.  \n",
    "   - Example:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     h = x_1w_1 + x_2w_2 + x_3w_3\n",
    "     $$  \n",

    "  \n",
    "## Forward Propagation (FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data flows from **Input → Hidden → Output**.  \n",
    "- We initially assign **random weights**.  \n",
    "- **Example:** Student’s activities (play, study, sleep) are inputs → hidden layer computes → output predicts performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Backward Propagation (BP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If prediction is wrong, the model **goes back** and adjusts weights.  \n",
    "- The process of updating weights to reduce error is called **backpropagation**.  \n",
    "- Goal: Minimize the difference between **actual vs predicted output**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Epoch\n",
    "- **1 Epoch = 1 Forward Propagation (FP) + 1 Backward Propagation (BP)**.  \n",

    "# Activation Functions in Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Activation Function?\n",
    "An **activation function** decides whether a neuron should \"fire\" (activate) or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Without activation functions → Neural networks become just **linear functions** (like linear regression).  \n",
    "- With activation functions → Networks can learn **non-linear patterns** in data (like curves, images, language).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple words:** Activation functions introduce **non-linearity**, which allows deep learning models to solve complex problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Need Activation Functions?\n",
    "1. **Non-linearity:** Real-world data is complex (e.g., image recognition, speech). Linear functions cannot model them.  \n",
    "2. **Feature learning:** Helps extract advanced features at different layers.  \n",
    "3. **Flexibility:** Different activation functions work better for different tasks (binary classification, multiclass, hidden layers).  \n",

    "- Smooth \"S\" shaped curve.  \n",

    "**Where to use:**  \n",
    "- **Binary classification problems** (output = probability).  \n",
    "- Always used in **output layer** when prediction must be probability between 0 and 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Predicting if an email is spam (1) or not spam (0).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent) Function**\n",
    "\n",

    "\\tanh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- Range: (-1, 1).  \n",
    "- \"S\" shaped curve, but allows negative values.  \n",
    "\n",

    "- When the data can have both positive and negative outputs.  \n",
    "- Better than sigmoid in hidden layers because it is centered around 0.  \n",
