    "# Deep Learning 03: Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the biological neural systems of the human brain. They are widely used in machine learning and deep learning due to their capability to approximate complex, non-linear functions and learn from data adaptively. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical discussion of Artificial Neural Networks, covering their architectural design, mathematical formulation, learning and training algorithms, advantages, limitations, and practical applications. The objective is to provide a structured and rigorous explanation suitable for academic and research contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks constitute a fundamental class of models in modern artificial intelligence and machine learning. Unlike traditional algorithmic approaches that rely on explicitly programmed rules, ANNs learn patterns directly from data through iterative optimization of parameters. This data-driven learning capability makes ANNs particularly effective for problems involving high-dimensional data, non-linearity, and uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "With advancements in computational power and optimization techniques, ANNs have become the foundation of deep learning architectures used in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Biological Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of Artificial Neural Networks is inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neurons. In biological systems, neurons receive electrical signals through dendrites, integrate them in the cell body, and transmit outputs via axons to other neurons. Learning occurs through the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, artificial neurons receive numerical inputs, apply weighted summation, pass the result through an activation function, and produce an output. Learning is achieved by adjusting connection weights based on observed errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Architecture of Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Artificial Neuron Model\n",
    "An artificial neuron is the fundamental processing unit of an ANN. It consists of:\n",
    "* **Input signals:** $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$\n",
    "* **Weights:** $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$\n",
    "* **Bias term:** $b$\n",
    "* **Activation function:** $f(\\cdot)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuron computes a weighted sum of inputs and applies a non-linear activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Layered Network Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "An ANN is typically organized into layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**\n",
    "   Receives raw input features and passes them to the hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layer(s)**\n",
    "   Performs intermediate computations and feature transformations. A network may contain one or multiple hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Layer**\n",
    "   Produces the final output, such as a class label or a continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the number of hidden layers, networks may be classified as shallow neural networks or deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Mathematical Modeling of ANN\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Neuron Output Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear combination of inputs for a neuron is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the neuron is obtained by applying an activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = f(z) $$\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* $x_i$ : Represents input features\n",
    "* $w_i$ : Denotes weights\n",
    "* $b$ : Is the bias term\n",
    "* $f(z)$ : Is the activation function\n",
    "* $a$ : Is the final neuron output (activation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling the modeling of complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common activation functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sigmoid Function**\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$f(z) = \\tanh(z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$ f(z) = \\max(0, z) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Training and Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Forward Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward propagation refers to the process of passing input data through the network layer by layer to compute predicted outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function quantifies the discrepancy between predicted outputs and actual target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss** for classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i)\\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i)\\right] $$\n",
    "### 5.3 Backpropagation Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is the primary learning algorithm used to train ANNs. It computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial z} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial w}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gradient is used to update the weights in the direction that minimizes the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Optimization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights are updated using optimization algorithms such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gradient Descent\n",
    "* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "* Adam Optimizer\n",
    "* RMSprop\n",
    "\n",
    "The general weight update rule is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w^{(t+1)} = w^{(t)} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Advantages of Artificial Neural Networks\n",

    "* Requirement of large labeled datasets\n",
    "* Difficulty in interpretability (black-box nature)\n",
    "* Risk of overfitting without proper regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Applications of ANN\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layer:**  \n",
    "  - Accuracy: ~85.5%  \n",
    "  - Performs reasonably well, but leaves some misclassifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers:**  \n",
    "  - Accuracy: ~86.6%  \n",
    "  - Best overall performance in terms of accuracy.  \n",
    "  - Fewer false positives compared to 1 hidden layer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers:**  \n",
    "  - Accuracy: ~86.0%  \n",
    "  - Slightly worse than 2 layers, indicating **adding more layers did not help**.  \n",
    "  - More false negatives (customers leaving were predicted as staying).  \n",

    "\n",
    "##  Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increasing from **1 → 2 hidden layers** improved performance.  \n",
    "- Adding a **3rd hidden layer** did **not** improve accuracy — in fact, performance dropped slightly.  \n",
    "- **Best Model:** ANN with **2 hidden layers**, giving **~86.6% accuracy**.  \n",
    "-  More layers are not always better — they may cause **overfitting** or unnecessary complexity.  \n",
    "- To further improve performance, we should explore:  \n",
    "  - **Hyperparameter tuning** (units per layer, learning rate, batch size).  \n",
    "  - **Regularization techniques** (Dropout, L2).  \n",
    "  - **Feature engineering** (new features, removing noisy ones).  \n"
